                The Temir group carries out basic and applied research with the goal of developing future information
                systems. Working at the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval, our
                focus is on societal challenges concerning quality and trustworthiness of information. Results are
                integrated into large-scale information systems, making use of crowdsourcing, data mining, machine
                learning, high-performance computing, and web technologies.</p>
